/* Question: when you have a function that calls for a procedure, you pretty much HAVE TO define a variable for the procedure operations 
on the parameters(operands?), as well as what to return, right? UNLESS it's an already defined function such as document.querySelector.*/

function multiply(num1,num2) {
  var result = num1 * num2;
  return result;
}

//Next question: in
document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {
    alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');
}
/*the 'alert' function doesn't need to be 'document.alert' because of lexical scoping, right? In other words, the alert is in the body of the 
'document.querySelector' function, so no need to keep specifiying the domain as 'document'. */
