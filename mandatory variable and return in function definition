/* Question: when you have a function that calls for a procedure, you pretty much HAVE TO define a variable for the procedure operations 
on the parameters(operands?), as well as what to return, right? UNLESS it's an already defined function such as document.querySelector.*/

function multiply(num1,num2) {
  var result = num1 * num2;
  return result;
}
